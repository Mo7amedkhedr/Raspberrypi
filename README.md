## üîå GPIO Control


# ‚ö° GPIO Control Setup

## GPIO Export
To export a GPIO pin, use the following command:
```
echo <pin_number> > /sys/class/gpio/export 
Example (Export pin 17):
echo 17 > /sys/class/gpio/export
```
## Set Direction
After exporting the pin, set the direction to either `in` or `out`:
```
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio<pin_number>/direction
Example (Set pin 17 as output):
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction
```
## Set Value
```
To control the pin value (high or low), use:
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio<pin_number>/value
To turn the pin on (high):
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
To turn the pin off (low):
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
```

**Full Example**
Here‚Äôs an example of exporting pin 17, setting it as an output, and turning it on (high):

```
echo 17 > /sys/class/gpio/export    # Export pin 17
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction  # Set as output
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value  # Turn pin 17 high
```

And turning it off (low):
```
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value  # Turn pin 17 low
```
## üî¶ Notes:

1- Replace <pin_number> with the actual GPIO pin number.

2- Ensure the pin is correctly exported before setting direction or value.

3- You may need root privileges to access GPIO files.

# üíª GPIO Control: Programming Examples

## **C Example (Using WiringPi Library)**

In this C example, we'll use the **WiringPi** library to control a GPIO pin and turn an LED on and off.

```
#include <wiringPi.h>

int main() {
    wiringPiSetup();           // Initialize WiringPi library
    pinMode(0, OUTPUT);        // Set GPIO pin 0 as output
    digitalWrite(0, HIGH);     // Turn LED on (HIGH)
    delay(1000);               // Wait for 1 second
    digitalWrite(0, LOW);      // Turn LED off (LOW)
    return 0;
}
```
## **Explanation**

-  **`wiringPiSetup()`**: Initializes the WiringPi library to set up the GPIO pin control system.
-  **`pinMode(0, OUTPUT)`**: Configures GPIO pin 0 as an **output** pin, allowing it to send signals.
-  **`digitalWrite(0, HIGH)`**: Turns the **LED on** by sending a **HIGH signal** (3.3V) to GPIO pin 0.
-  **`delay(1000)`**: Pauses the program for **1 second** to keep the LED on.
-  **`digitalWrite(0, LOW)`**: Turns the **LED off** by sending a **LOW signal** (0V) to GPIO pin 0.


## **Python Example:**

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO    #  Import the RPi.GPIO library
import time                #  Import the time library for sleep functionality

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)     #  Set the GPIO mode to BCM (Broadcom pin numbering)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)   #  Set GPIO pin 18 as an output

GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)  #  Turn the LED on (send HIGH signal)
time.sleep(1)               #  Wait for 1 second

GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)   #  Turn the LED off (send LOW signal)
GPIO.cleanup()              #  Cleanup GPIO settings
```
## üîÑ **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**

PWM allows precise control of devices like servos and motors by varying the duty cycle. Here's an example setup to control an LED's brightness or motor speed:

```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO   #  Import the RPi.GPIO library
import time               #  Import the time library for sleep functionality

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)    #  Set GPIO mode to BCM (Broadcom pin numbering)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)  #  Set GPIO pin 18 as an output

# PWM Setup
pwm = GPIO.PWM(18, 100)   #  Initialize PWM on pin 18 with 100 Hz frequency
pwm.start(50)              #  Start PWM with a 50% duty cycle (50% on, 50% off)

time.sleep(2)              #  Wait for 2 seconds to observe PWM effect
pwm.stop()                 #  stop the PWM signal
GPIO.cleanup()             #  Cleanup GPIO settings
```

## üìü Controlling a Servo Motor with PWM on Raspberry Pi

**Overview:**

This document demonstrates how to control a servo motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on a Raspberry Pi. PWM is a technique where the duty cycle of a digital signal is modulated to control analog devices like servos.

**Hardware Setup:**

1. **Raspberry Pi:** The computing device used to generate the PWM signal.
2. **Servo Motor:** The actuator to be controlled.
3. **Breadboard:** (Optional) For easy connection of components.
4. **Jumper Wires:** To connect the servo motor to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

**Software Setup:**

1. **Enable PWM:**
    * **Enable the PWM peripheral in the device tree.** (This step may vary depending on your Raspberry Pi model and operating system.)
    * **Create the PWM device node:**

        ```
        sudo mkdir -p /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0
        sudo ln -s /dev/pwmchip0 /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0 
        ```

2. **Export the PWM channel:**

    ```
    echo <PWM_channel> > /sys/class/gpio/export 
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/export 
    ```
    (To export PWM channel 0)

3. **Set the PWM period:**

    ```
    echo <period> > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm<PWM_channel>/period 
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```
    echo 20000000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period 
    ```
    (Sets the period to 20 milliseconds)

4. **Set the duty cycle:**

    ```
    echo <duty_cycle> > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm<PWM_channel>/duty_cycle 
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```
    echo 1500000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/duty_cycle 
    ```
    (Sets the duty cycle to 1500000 out of 20000000, which corresponds to a mid-point position for many servos)

**Controlling the Servo:**

- To move the servo to different positions, change the `duty_cycle` value. 
- **Note:** The valid duty cycle range and its mapping to servo positions vary depending on the servo motor. Consult the servo motor's datasheet for specific values.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Configure GPIO pin for PWM
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # Use BCM GPIO numbering
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)  # Assuming PWM channel 0 is mapped to GPIO18

# Create PWM object
pwm = GPIO.PWM(18, 50)  # 50Hz frequency
pwm.start(0)  # Start with 0% duty cycle

# Move servo to different positions
try:
    while True:
        # Position 1
        pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(2.5)  # Adjust duty cycle as needed
        time.sleep(1)

        # Position 2
        pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(7.5)
        time.sleep(1)

        # Position 3
        pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(12.5)
        time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pwm.stop()
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

## üîß Three Options to Integrate Hardware with an ECU

This diagram outlines three primary approaches to integrating hardware devices with an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), typically found in automotive or embedded systems.

**1. User Space Integration:**

* **Description:** In this approach, user-space applications interact with hardware drivers directly using system calls like `read()`, `write()`, and `ioctl()`. 
* **Pros:** Relatively straightforward to implement for simple devices.
* **Cons:** Can lead to performance bottlenecks and potential security risks due to direct access to hardware.
* **Example:** A user-space application using the GPIO library to control an LED.

**2. Kernel Space Integration (with existing drivers):**

* **Description:** If a suitable driver already exists in the kernel, user-space applications can interact with the hardware through the driver's interface.
* **Pros:** Leverages existing, well-tested drivers, improving performance and reliability.
* **Cons:** Requires knowledge of the driver's API.
* **Example:** A user-space application using the character device interface to control a UART.

**3. Kernel Space Integration (with custom driver):**

* **Description:** For devices without existing drivers, a custom driver needs to be written and integrated into the kernel.
* **Pros:** Provides maximum control and flexibility over hardware interaction.
* **Cons:** Requires in-depth knowledge of kernel programming and device driver development.
* **Example:** Writing a custom driver for a new sensor or actuator.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Device Tree Compatibility:** For modern systems, the device tree (DT) plays a crucial role in configuring and managing hardware. Ensure that your integration method is compatible with the DT.
* **Performance:** The choice of integration method will impact system performance. Kernel-space drivers generally offer better performance due to lower overhead.
* **Security:** Direct user-space access to hardware can pose security risks. Consider using appropriate security measures to protect the system.

## üîå UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

**Description:**

UART is a serial communication protocol used to transmit data between devices. It's asynchronous, meaning the sender and receiver don't need to be synchronized by a clock signal. 

**Key Features:**

* **Simple and Versatile:** UART is relatively easy to implement and widely used in various applications.
* **Asynchronous:** Data transmission doesn't rely on a shared clock signal.
* **Full-duplex:** Allows simultaneous data transmission and reception.
* **Low-cost:** UART interfaces are typically inexpensive to implement.

**Data Format:**

UART data is transmitted serially, one bit at a time, over a single wire. The data format typically includes:

* **Start Bit:** A low-level signal indicating the beginning of a data frame.
* **Data Bits:** 7 or 8 bits of data.
* **Parity Bit:** An optional parity bit for error checking.
* **Stop Bit:** A high-level signal indicating the end of a data frame.

**Applications:**

* **Microcontroller Communication:** Connecting microcontrollers to sensors, actuators, and other peripherals.
* **GPS Receivers:** Interfacing with GPS modules to receive location data.
* **Modems:** Communicating with modems for data transmission over phone lines.
* **Serial Consoles:** Connecting to devices for debugging and configuration.

**Example:**

* Connecting an Arduino microcontroller to a GPS module to receive location data.
* Connecting a Raspberry Pi to a Bluetooth module for wireless communication.

## UART Connection on Raspberry Pi

****


**Description:**

This diagram showcases a typical setup for connecting a Raspberry Pi to a PC/Laptop using a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface.

**Key Components:**

* **Raspberry Pi:** The single-board computer acting as the host.
* **USB to Serial Converter:** This device converts the USB signal from the PC to the UART signals (TX, RX, GND) required for communication with the Raspberry Pi.
* **USB Cable:** Connects the PC to the USB to Serial Converter.
* **UART Pins:** The Raspberry Pi uses specific GPIO pins for UART communication:
    - **GPIO14 (TXD0):** Transmit data from the Raspberry Pi.
    - **GPIO15 (RXD0):** Receive data to the Raspberry Pi.
    * **GND:** Ground connection.
* **Voltage Levels:** It's crucial to note that the Raspberry Pi's UART pins operate at 3.3V logic levels. Connecting them directly to 5V systems can damage the Pi. The USB to Serial Converter typically handles the voltage level conversion.

**Connection Steps:**

1. **Connect the USB to Serial Converter:** Plug the USB connector into the PC.
2. **Connect the UART Pins:** Connect the TX, RX, and GND pins of the USB to Serial Converter to the corresponding GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi (GPIO14, GPIO15, and GND).
3. **Configure UART:** Enable the UART interface on the Raspberry Pi and configure the baud rate and other settings as needed.
4. **Establish Communication:** Use a terminal emulator on the PC to establish a serial connection with the Raspberry Pi.

**Applications:**

* **Debugging and Monitoring:** Accessing the Raspberry Pi's console and monitoring system logs.
* **Remote Control:** Controlling the Raspberry Pi remotely using commands sent over the serial connection.
* **Data Transfer:** Sending and receiving data between the Raspberry Pi and the PC.

# üõ†Ô∏è Software Development and System Configuration

## üìÑ Overview

### üìÇ Sys Folder

The `Sys Folder` section typically lists available serial ports on the system. Common serial ports include:

- `ttyS0`
- `ttyS1`
- `ttyUSB0`
- `ttyUSB1`

These ports are used for serial communication.

### üñ•Ô∏è `stty` Command

The `stty` command is a powerful utility in Linux for configuring terminal settings. Below are some examples of how to use the `stty` command to configure serial port settings.

#### Example 1: Setting Baud Rate

```
stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 115200
stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 115200 line 0 -brkint -imaxbel
```


# Serial Communication on Raspberry Pi

## Context

This guide demonstrates how to configure and test serial communication on a Raspberry Pi using terminal commands. The `stty` command is used to configure the serial port settings, while the `echo` command is used to send data to the serial port.

## Key Elements

### `stty` Command

The `stty` command is used to configure the serial port settings. Below are the key elements of the command:

* **Targeting the Serial Port:**
    ```
    stty -F /dev/ttyS0
    ```
    This command targets the serial port `/dev/ttyS0`.

* **Setting the Baud Rate:**
    ```
    stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 9600
    ```
    Sets the baud rate for serial communication to 9600 bits per second.

* **Resetting Line Discipline:**
    ```
    stty -F /dev/ttyS0 line 0
    ```
    Resets the line discipline to the default settings.

* **Disabling Software Flow Control:**
    ```sh
    stty -F /dev/ttyS0 -brkint -imaxbel
    ```
    Disables software flow control mechanisms.

### Sending Data

To send data to the serial port, use the `echo` command:

```
echo "hello" > /dev/ttyS0
```
**Example**

Here is a complete example of configuring and testing serial communication on a Raspberry Pi:

```
# Configure the serial port
stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 9600 line 0 -brkint -imaxbel

# Send data to the serial port
echo "hello" > /dev/ttyS0

# Monitor the output of the serial port
tail -f /dev/ttyS0
```
